Backup-GPOs.ps1 -- by Eric Wallace <wallae@mmc.org>, December 2011


.SYNOPSIS

Automated backup of Group Policy objects.


.NOTES

This script must be run from an account with Domain Admins permissions on the target domain(s).


.PARAMETER domainLst

Domain name, or a list of domain names separated by commas only (no spaces!)


.PARAMETER searchTxt

A word or part of a word that should be in the GPO's display name. If you use this search option,
only the GPOs matching this term will be backed up.


.PARAMETER backupDir

Directory for saving the GPO backups. The folder structure will be created automatically.


.PARAMETER daysOld

The script can automatically delete any backups older than the given number of days. The default
is to disable cleanup, or you can set this option to 0 days which will also disable the cleanup.


.EXAMPLE

(Parameters can be listed in order, or by using optional named parameter flags shown in brackets.
Text must be in quotes if it contains spaces, otherwise quotes are unnecessary.)

Backup all GPOs from the current user's domain to the default location:
  .\Backup-GPOs.ps1

Backup all GPOs for multiple domains:
  .\Backup-GPOs.ps1 [-domainLst] mehealth.org,mmcf.mehealth.org,mhr.mehealth.org

Backup only GPOs with the word "test" in their name:
  .\Backup-GPOs.ps1 [-domainLst] mmcf.mehealth.org [-searchTxt] test
  
Backup defaults except to a specific directory (remember to use quotes if it contains spaces):
  .\Backup-GPOs.ps1 -backupDir C:\My_GPO_Backups
  
Use defaults, except cleanup backup folders older than 15 days:
  .\Backup-GPOs.ps1 -daysOld 15

Use defaults, except disable cleanup of old backup folders by specifying 0 days' retention (default):
  .\Backup-GPOs.ps1 -daysOld 0
  
All parameters specified positionally (note that here the search term is blank):
  .\Backup-GPOs.ps1 mmcf.mehealth.org "" C:\GPOBackups 15
